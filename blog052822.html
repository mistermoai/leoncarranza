    <h3>Storytelling in Form: How the Architecture of the Philippines Reflects its History</h3>
      <p>Modern notions of what architecture ought to be—protective and exclusionary of nature as well as complementing a sedentary mode of living—creates a standard of critique that leads to other modes of construction being overlooked, particularly indigenous architecture. In the Philippines, various tribes have adhered to traditions as best as they could during the present as global capital made it harder to sustain themselves and the environments they lived in. This perseverance of long-standing methods of building until the present allows for an examination of not only the architecture, but also of the historical aspects of the Philippines. Projects such as the Palace in the Sky, now the People's Park in the Sky, tell the story of struggle against dictatorship through the enormity of its form and its context. Although they are much smaller by comparison, the houses of the Badjaos and those in the Batanes tell stories about tradition, displacement, and perseverance that are just as rich. </p>

    <h4>1.1 Palace in the Sky </h4>
    <p> Mount Sungay, located in the Tagaytay region, was home to generations of peasant farmers. In the 1980s work began on a mansion commissioned by Imelda Marcos which led to the farmers’ evacuation with no compensation. The process to create this mansion was expensive, resource-intensive, and most notably environmentally detrimental as construction required the destruction of the peak, deemed inaccessible by the architects. The house itself was massive enough to fit a pool, a disco, a veranda, and was made with expensive materials such as narra wood [Cawley]. This process was greatly expedited after then-President Ronald Reagan announced his visit to the Philippines. Although it was planned for him to stay in the Palace in the Sky, his cancellation left the house unfinished as construction ceased past the end of the Marcos regime. After the dictator’s flight to Hawaii, the public were able to enter the now-unguarded house. Upon seeing its interior, the Palace then became a symbol of the excess and wastefulness of the dictatorship, as well as their neglect for the impoverished.</p>


    <h4>1.2 People’s Park in the Sky </h4>
    <p>What was once a highly guarded place exclusive to the elite and closed off to the public is now a place for them. This transformation of the same space to accommodate a different purpose is manifested in not only the people allowed on the site, but also through the circulation within it and the usage of the site itself. The summit is now accessible either through a ten-minute hike or through a jeepney ride—a stark contrast to the seemingly impenetrable nature of the area during the dictatorship. The site is also visited for its view, its proximity to Taal Volcano, its shops, as well as the preserved Shrine of Our Lady Mother of Fair Love. The focus is not primarily on the lavish house, indicating a greater appreciation for its environmental context.</p>
    <p>This shift in architectural program also finds itself in critiques of modernism: the assumption that buildings are singular and clear in their functions is rejected, as over time architecture is often repurposed or reinterpreted. This reinterpretation is clear in this transformation from a palace to a park for the people, but also further highlights the arrogance of people who fashion themselves permanent fixtures, as though to cement their rule. </p>


    <h4>2.1 Badjaos </h4>
    <p>Although considered a tribe indigenous to the Philippines, the Badjaos people have no official nationality. They are known to be located on the coastline of Mindanao, but in actuality roam the entirety of the Southeast Asian shores. They traditionally made their living and sustenance through free-diving for fish. </p>
    <p>However, these enduring customs are under threat due to the modernization of the Philippines, which has led to overfishing, as well as a mass displacement of the people into the inner lands. This extreme poverty, the need to address living in a modern world, and the struggle to sustain their traditions all inform the Badjaos architecture that endures until today [Al Jazeera]. </p>
    <p>For the population that still lives on the coast, the homes they inhabit take the form of houses on stilts. Built from driftwood that came from neighboring cities, the process of construction is a communal one in which people work together to anchor the base of each stilt between rocks and coral in a way that does not harm aquatic life. These houses are a stark contrast to the lavishness of the Palace in the Sky in its respect for its environmental context. They are interventions that make an otherwise unfriendly place more hospitable. In doing so, the coastline becomes an inviting place for a community to live, as opposed to one that drives away the original inhabitants.</p>
    <p>An entirely different framework of construction is also on display; exorbitant amounts of money were spent to erect the palace, with the understanding that it was for a singular client, and that this client outweighed the importance of everyone else involved in its creation. Conversely, each person that worked on the construction of the Badjao houses does it as a means of providing shelter for themselves and for each other. There is no hierarchy or client-designer relationship that one would expect in a built environment influenced by wealth.
    The fragility of these homes makes sense, given the tumultuousness of the ocean—any construction would be easily leveled [Jacobson]. Instead, the Badjaos build knowing that they may have to move at any second, as they have before during natural disasters, but also now due to their displacement. In a time in architecture dominated by desires for permanence, to leave one’s mark, and to display power, these structures not meant to last reveal a sense of adaptability that is wholly opposed to these values. </p>


    <h4>3.1 Batanes</h4>
    <p>The houses of the Batanes, in contrast, are permanent and anchored to the ground. They are built “of lime, stone, wood and thatch” [Ignacio, 1]. Through materials alone, the context of these Ivatan Houses is revealed: these are heavy materials that are sourced locally. They are meant to fasten these houses to the ground, protecting its inhabitants from the strong winds of the northernmost islands of the Philippines in a way that is unique to that region. In pre-colonial times, these houses are places for resting, cooking, and eating.
    This piling method of building, especially the variants made out of lime, wood and stone, allowed for multi-leveled units of housing, allowing for storage in some areas. As opposed to the Badjaos, whose architecture is predicated upon their frequent movement from place to place, Ivatan architecture complements a sedentary lifestyle. It is a building style that nonetheless takes advantage of, and protects its inhabitants from the environment specific to the Batanes.</p>
    <p>These examples of Filipino architecture all must address a certain context, but do so in different ways. The Palace in the Sky neglects it completely and creates one of its own, Badjaos architecture is collapsible with movement in mind, and Ivatan houses utilize local elements as a method of protection. However, what unites them is their ability to store memories; whether these are memories of struggle, of displacement, or perseverance, the history of a people is immortalized in each of these continuing forms. </p>

    <h2><a href="architecture.html">Architecture</a> - Studio Fall 2021</h2>
    <div class="description">
      <em>The Fall 2021 Studio was all about domesticity. Our prompt required the addition of a domestic "plus," this "plus" being any sort of addition that you wouldn't otherwise find in a loosely defined "conventional" domestic space.</em>
    </div>

        <img src="images/architecture/studio/studio_final_axon_transformation.jpg" alt="axon transformation">
        <p>For me, this "plus" was simply a renovation of an existing house on the site in Ithaca. I focused on the tectonics of the light timber frame house, paying careful attention to show these different layers of structure and cladding.</p>

        <img src="images/architecture/studio/studio_final_axonometric.jpg" alt="house axonometric">
        <p>The result is a sort of "skeleton" of a former house, wrapping itself around a renovated existing house, and the extended addition, differentiated by its flat, as opposed to gabled, roof.</p>

        <strong>What follows are select views from different parts of the house; I took care to juxtapose old and new in a variety of ways:</strong>

        <img src="images/architecture/studio/studio_final_drawing1.jpg" alt="studio final drawing 1">
        <p>A stud frame wall demarcates the threshold between the addition and the renovated part of the house.</p>

        <img src="images/architecture/studio/studio_final_drawing2.jpg" alt="studio final drawing 2">
        <p>A steel staircase, atypical of a light timber framed house, serves as an alternate entrance to the porch overlooking the skeletal frame.</p>

        <img src="images/architecture/studio/studio_final_drawing3.jpg" alt="studio final drawing 3">
        <p>This is another perspective showing the threshold between old and new from the viewpoint of the old and renovated part. You can also see the exposed rafters above.</p>

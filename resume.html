  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <div class="description">
    <p>I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Architecture at Cornell University. I come from a background
      of graphic design, traditional art, technology, and social change. I carry forward all of these aspects with me in
      my design practice, as I continually create bridges between the different branches of knowledge that I engage with
      in the university.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I am ultimately pursuing a career in Computational Design. My experiences in architecture involved several tools for 
      digital fabrication, parametric design, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Likewise, the classes I have
      taken outside of my department, including in computer science, game design, and cultural studies, have helped me to see the world
      through different, yet fundamentally related, ontological lenses. This accumulation of skills and experiences make
      me excited to work in a field dedicated to exploring design, computers, interactions, and the intersections
      between fields of knowledge.

        <h3>Core Architecture Design Studio</h3>
        <h4>Taken every semester since 2020</h4>
        <p>Produce architectural drawings, plans, sections, models, and other fabricated objects for 2-3 semester-long
          projects. Through these classes, I have learned more about the iterative design process, time management, and 
          what it truly means to be critical of one's work. In my 2023 Fall Semester, my focus was on creating a foundational 
          understanding of machine learning and neural networks, and artificial intelligence. The following 2024 Spring 
          semester expanded on this by integrating Generative AI tools as a part of our design process.

        <h3>CS1110: Introduction to Computing: A Design and Development Perspective</h3>

        <h4>Spring 2024</h4>
        <p>Learned the fundamentals of Python programming, and advanced topics including modules, libraries, 
          objects, creating classes, recursion, and searching algorithms. 7 projects were assigned pertaining 
          to these topics throughout the semester. External to the class, I learned to integrate python scripts
          
        </p>
        
        <h3>Coding for Design</h3>
        <h4>Spring 2024</h4>
        <p>In department architecture elective in which we learned the fundamentals of programming in C# for Unity.
          Culminated into a final project for the semester in which I built a VR game with a team of three.
        </p>

        <h3>Urban Simulations</h3>
        <h4>Spring 2023</h4>
        <p>In department architecture elective in which we learned the fundamentals of programming through blueprints
          in Unreal Engine. This was my first time truly experiencing object-oriented programming through the lens of 
          node-based, visual programming, as well as my first time using a program to dynamically represent a designed
          interaction.
        </p>

        <h3>INFO 1300: Introductory Design and Programming for the Web</h3>
        <h4>Spring 2022</h4>
        <p>Out-of-department elective which introduced me to web development, hosting, and the design and testing 
          process. I learned, in particular how to make websites more accessible through responsive html, css, and jquery
          scripts. These methods are what this website is built upon.

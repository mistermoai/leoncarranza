          <h3>"Salvation" (2019)</h3>

          <!-- Source: salvation, Leon Carranza -->
          <p>I guess I was really panicking during my senior year. I wasn't sure what I'd do with my life after high school—I certainly had my aspirations, but nothing was guaranteed until I knew where I'd go to college. While I waited, I realized everything would be alright, and to express visually this I really dove into this theme of nature taking over human-made objects.</p>

          <h3>"Abstraction" (2019)</h3>
          <img src="images/art/art_abstraction.png" alt="abstraction">
          <!-- Source: abstraction, Leon Carranza -->
          <p>Explores the idea that we don't usually know the in's-and-out's and the inner workings of technology, but that doesn't stop us from using it, and getting addicted to it.</p>
        </article>

          <h3>"Daredevil" (2022)</h3>
          <img src="images/art/art_daredevil.jpg" alt="daredevil">
          <!-- Source: daredevil, Leon Carranza -->
          <p>I've been watching <em>Daredevil</em> on Netflix lately. I have a tradition of drawing characters from TV shows and other media that I resonate with or find exceptional.</p>
        </article>

          <h3>"Fences" (2020)</h3>
          <img src="images/art/art_fences.png" alt="fences">
          <!-- Source: fences, Leon Carranza -->
          <p>Another piece exploring the theme of nature overtaking.</p>
        </article>

          <h3>"Gris" (2020)</h3>
          <img src="images/art/art_gris.png" alt="gris">
          <!-- Source: gris, Leon Carranza -->
          <p>I fell hopelessly in love with <em>Gris</em>—a platformer so simply presented and yet so emotionally and stylistically impactful. This is the titular character. </p>
        </article>

          <h3>"Kaleidoscope" (2019)</h3>
          <img src="images/art/art_kaleidoscope.jpg" alt="kaleidoscope">
          <!-- Source: kaleidoscope, Leon Carranza -->
          <p>I tried to do something in the style of James Jean—an artist, and major inspiration to my own work.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>"Life in Ruins" (2020)</h3>
          <img src="images/art/art_life_in_ruins.jpg" alt="life in ruins">
          <!-- Source: life in ruins, Leon Carranza -->
          <p> <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> has to be one of, if not my favorite game of all time. Its atmosphere of overgrowth and nature just came at the right time for me, so here I depicted Link standing right next to a decayed Guardian. </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>"Root" (2020)</h3>
          <img src="images/art/art_root.png" alt="root">
          <!-- Source: root, Leon Carranza -->
          <p>An experiment with gradients in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>"Memento" (2019)</h3>
          <img src="images/art/art_memento.png" alt="root">
          <!-- Source: memento, Leon Carranza -->
          <p>An expressive drawing recounting my visits to 14th Street Union Square in New York City.</p>
